<h1><b> General concepts with regards to dynamic array </b></h1>
    
    <h2> Time complexity </h2>
            Dynamic array has time complexity of amortised constant (1) -> for insertion at the end, since we resize and spread the cost over the 
            infrequent resizing that occurs when the array is near completion.
    
            vectors in c++ and python are very similar to the aforementioned concept.
